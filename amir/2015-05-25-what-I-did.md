# What I did this week (May, 25th, 2015)

* First three suggested reading of [Deep learning for NLP](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) 
* First two notes of module 1 of [CNN for visual recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/)
* First 17 pages of [Machine Learning II, Graphical Models](http://cvlab-dresden.de/HTML/people/bogdan/teaching/slides-script/ml2-ss15/lectures-script.pdf)
	* There are still some bugs
	* Some parts still needs more work to understand
* I also read some part of Vladimirs parametric maxflow code. But, still needs a lot of work and should change my energy minimization problems a bit.
