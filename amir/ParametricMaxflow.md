#Parametric Maxflow code of Vladimir
[TOC]
##Introduction
In order to compare our approximateES for parametric maxflow results with the original exact inference, I just started to read parametric maxflow code of Vladimir Kolmogorov. It took some time for me to compile it on linux. There is a *MatlabÂ®* wrapper in the code which simplifies the stuff. However, it uses *mex_grabcut.dll* for computing unary terms.
