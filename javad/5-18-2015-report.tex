We want to find a data-driven pixel-convolved model of the PSF for the imaging data of HST WFC3/IR
instrument. We model the $D$ dimensional observed images of stars $\{y_i\}$ as a $H^2D$ dimensional 
super-resolution PSF $X$ sampled at the data grid:

\begin{equation}
y_i= f_iXK^{(i)} + B_i + e_i,
\end{equation}

where $f_i$ is the brightness of the star $i$, $B_i$ is the flat-field at the patch $i$, and $e_i$ is 
a Gaussian noise model with the variance $var_i$
\begin{equation}
var_i = \sigma^{2} + g(f_iXK^{(i)} + B_i),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^{2}$, $g$ are the uncorrelated Gaussian background noise, and the gain respectively.
In order to find the optimal estimates of $\{X,f,B\}$ we maximize the following negative log-likelihood:

\begin{equation}
NLL = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{D} \frac{y_{ij}-f_{i}\sum_{l=1}^{H^{2}D}X_{l}K^{(i)}_{lj}-B_{i}}{var_{i}} + \epsilon.\sum_{n,m}\sum_{k=\pm1} |X_{n\pm k,m\pm k}-X_{n,m}|^{2},
\end{equation}
where the second term comes from smoothness prior with the strength set by hyper-parameter $\epsilon$.

There's more to write and I have so many plots to show, but tangy is extremely low.
Nonetheless, this is a good start towards conquering GoshaDy.
